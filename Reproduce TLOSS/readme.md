About unsupervised time series learning
--------------

Unsupervised learning is an approach in which a model **learns patterns, relationships, or structures** in data without the need for explicit labels or target outputs. In unsupervised learning time series learning, the studies primarily focus on using time series as input and employing self-learning techniques to obtain representations that can be applied to various downstream tasks such as forecasting, classification and anomaly detection. This approach **aims to accelerate the learning speed and performance of downstream tasks while endowing unsupervised models with strong transferability**.

About TLOSS
--------------

TLOSS is a landmark model in unsupervised time series representation learning, which is proposed in [Neurips 19](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2019/hash/53c6de78244e9f528eb3e1cda69699bb-Abstract.html). Drawing inspiration from Word2Vec, it formulates unsupervised learning tasks for deep learning models. In this project, I will provide a brief introduction to the model and re-implement it based on [a relevent study](https://github.com/emadeldeen24/TS-TCC). Furthermore, I will conduct testing on datasets that were not evaluated in the original study.
